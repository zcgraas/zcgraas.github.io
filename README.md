# What it is.

This is the source repo of my portfolio site hosted on github pages.

## How it was built.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 
React was the first JS framework I learned, and the one I feel most confident with.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
